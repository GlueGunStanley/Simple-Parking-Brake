# Super's Parking Brake

## What is it?

This is a simple resource to where cars now have parking brakes! This replaces the handbrake (DEFAULT: Spacebar) but you can change that in the config.

## Installation

Installation is pretty simple, just [download](https://github.com/supazorik/ParkingBrake/releases/tag/v1.0.0) the folder, slap it into your resources folder and type this into your server.cfg

```
start super_parkingbrake
```

> Note:
> Make sure you have baseevents started in your server.cfg `ensure baseevents`
