# Super's Parking Brake

## What is it?

This is a simple resource for [FiveM](https://fivem.net) to where cars now have parking brakes! This replaces the handbrake (DEFAULT: Spacebar) but you can change that in the config. This resource also networks the parking breaks, what does this mean? Well, if player A turns on the parking brake for Car A and then gets out, player B would see the parking brake on for Car A if they get in.

## Installation

Installation is pretty simple, just [download](https://github.com/supazorik/ParkingBrake/releases/tag/v1.0.0) the folder, slap it into your resources folder and type this into your server.cfg

```
start super_parkingbrake
```

> Note:
> Make sure you have baseevents started in your server.cfg `ensure baseevents`
