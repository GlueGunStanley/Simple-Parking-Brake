# Simple Parking Brake

This is a simple resource for [FiveM](https://fivem.net) to where cars now have parking brakes! This replaces the handbrake (DEFAULT: Spacebar) but you can change that in the config. This resource also networks the parking brakes, what does this mean? Well, if player A turns on the parking brake for Car A and then gets out, player B would see the parking brake on for Car A if they get in.
